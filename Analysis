# Analysis deep-learning-challenge 

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a tool that can help select the applicants for funding with the best change of success in their ventures. 

## Questions 
1. What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    - Application type and classifications were used as targets. 
    
2. What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    - All columns from the charity_data.csv minus the EIN and NAME (which were dropped) were used for the model. 
    
3. What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    - EIN and NAME
    
4. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural  network model, and why?
    - In my original model, my first hidden layer used relu activation with 5 units, in my second later used tanh with 8 units, my output layer used sigmoid activation with one unit and ran with 20 epochs. My accuracy score was 72.66%
    
5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    - Unfortunately, I was not able to reach the target model performance, the highest accuracy I was able to acheive was 73.22% accuracy.
    
6. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
    - When trying to optimize the models performance I tried changing the activation elements (relu, sigmoid, and tanh) and changing the units in the hidden layers. My optimized model first hidden layer had relu activation with 7 units, the second layer had sigmoid activation with 14 units, and the outer layer had sigmoid activation with 1 unit. I noticed when changing the activation of the outer layer there was a decrease in the accuracy sore, so for my optimized model I kept it constant with the original model. 
    
## Conclusion
The various layers used in deep machine learning is useful as they help models learn how to predict and classify information.
